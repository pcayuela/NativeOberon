Some comments:

HTML.Compile * translates a text to an HTML text.  TestHTML.Text is a sample input file.  Mark it, apply HTML.Compile and you will get a file named TestHTML.html.  The target file name is the first word in the file.  In the input, color of text has significance; header information is in red, links are in blue.  It is explained in TestHTML.Text and also in HTML.Mod.
