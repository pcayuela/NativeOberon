An airplane is circling for a landing in Atlanta. It's totally fogged in, zero
visibility, and suddenly there's a small electrical fire in the cockpit which
disables all of the instruments and the radio. The pilot continues circling, 
totally lost, when suddenly he finds himself flying next to a tall office building. %\

When {% (FONT Oberon20i.Scn.Fnt) (COL 13) Albert Einstein %}
was making the rounds of the speaker's circuit, he  usually found himself eagerly
longing to get back to his laboratory work.  One night as they were driving to yet
another rubber-chicken  dinner, Einstein mentioned to his chauffeur
(a man who somewhat resembled Einstein in looks & manner) that
he was tired of speechmaking.

{% (COM PowerDoc.Flip) {% (COL 8) "I have and idea, boss," %} his chauffeur said. {% (COL 8) 
"I've heard you give this speech so many times. I'll bet I could give it
for you." %} Einstein laughed loudly and said, {% (COL 8) "Why not?
Let's do it!" %} %}

When they arrive at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur's cap and 
jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful 
rendition of Einstein's speech and even answered a few questions expertly.

Then a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question 
about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone 
in the audience know that he was nobody's fool. Without missing a beat, 
the chauffeur fixed the professor with a steely stare and said,  {% (COL 6)

 	 ROME (Reuter) - An Italian who was late for his plane called
 police on his cellular telephone to say there was a bomb on
 board so the flight would be delayed.
 	 Police said the caller was a Neapolitan who had been racing
 along the highway to Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci airport to catch a
 1 a.m. Alitalia flight to Caracas Wednesday.
 	 They traced the call to the man's mobile phone, dialed the
 number and discovered him in a line at the check-in-desk.
 	 The man, named only as D.L., was charged with creating a
 false alarm but was allowed to board the plane.
 	 It took off 35 minutes late after a search found no sign of
 a bomb.

Wie man Elefanten jagt.

MATHEMATIKER jagen Elefanten, indem sie nach Afrika gehen, alles
   entfernen, was nicht Elefant ist, und ein Element der Restmenge
   fangen.

ERFAHRENE MATHEMATIKER werden zunaechst versuchen: die Existenz
   mindestens eines eineindeutigen Elefanten zu beweisen, bevor
   sie mit Schritt 1 als untergeordneter Uebungsaufgabe fortfahren.

MATHEMATIKPROFESSOREN beweisen die Existenz mindestens eines
   eineindeutigen Elefanten und ueberlassen dann das Aufspueren und
   Einfangen eines tatsaechlichen Elefanten ihren Studenten.

INFORMATIKER jagen Elefanten, indem sie Algorithmus A ausfuehren:
   A)
   1.) gehe nach Afrika
   2.) beginne am Kap der guten Hoffnung
   3.) durchkreuze Afrika von Sueden nach Norden bidirektional in
       Ost-West-Richtung
   4.) fuer jedes Durchkreuzen tue:
     a.) fange jedes Tier, das du siehst
     b.) vergleiche jedes gefangene Tier mit einem als Elefant bekannten Tier
     c.) halte an bei Uebereinstimmung

ERFAHRENE PROGRAMMIERER veraendern Algorithmus A, indem sie ein als
   Elefant bekanntes Tier in Kairo plazieren, damit das Programm
   in jedem Fall korrekt beendet wird.

ASSEMBLER-PROGRAMMIERER bevorzugen die Ausfuehrung von Algorithmus
   A auf Haenden und Knien.

SQL-PROGRAMMIERER verwenden folgenden Ausdruck:
   SELECT Elefant FROM Afrika.

NATURAL-PROGRAMMIERER lassen sich von ADABAS einen Elefanten bringen.

INGENIEURE jagen Elefanten, indem sie nach Afrika gehen, jedes graue
   Tier fangen, das ihnen ueber den Weg laeuft und es als Elefant
   nehmen, wenn das Gewicht nicht mehr als 15% von dem eines vorher
   gefangenen Elefanten abweicht.

WIRTSCHAFTSWISSENSCHAFTLER jagen keine Elefanten. Aber sie sind fest
   davon ueberzeugt, dass die Elefanten sich selber stellen wuerden,
   wenn man ihnen nur genug bezahlt.

STATISTIKER jagen das erste Tier, das sie sehen n-mal und nennen es
   Elefant.

UNTERNEHMENSBERATER jagen keine Elefanten. Und viele haben noch niemals
   ueberhaupt irgendetwas gejagt. Aber man kann sie stundenweise 
   engagieren, um sich gute Ratschlaege geben zu lassen.

SYSTEMANALYTIKER waeren theoretisch in der Lage, die Korrelation
   zwischen Hutgroesse und Trefferquote bei der Elefantenjagd zu
   bestimmen, wenn ihnen nur jemand sagen wuerde, was ein Elefant ist.

ELEFANTENJAGD FUER JEDERMANN:
   Ich gehe nach Afrika, baue einen Kaefig auf, setze mich hinein und
   definiere: Ich bin draussen. -> Alle Elefanten gefangen.

HANDWERKER fangen Elefanten, indem sie einen aufspueren, ihm den
   Kostenvoranschlag zuschicken und versprechen, Uebermorgen wiederzukommen.

TELEKOM-MITARBEITER fangen Elefanten, indem sie ihnen eine kostenlose
   Anrufweiterschaltung versprechen und sie bitten Donnerstag zu Hause zu
   bleiben weil der Monteur *ganz bestimmt* am Donnerstag kommt.

INVESTMENTBERATER fangen Elefanten, indem sie taeglich mindestens 50
   anrufen und ihnen von den traumhaften Chancen auf dem Warenterminmarkt
   fuer Heu erzaehlen.

MICROSOFT VB's brauchen keine Elefanten zu fangen. Diese stellen sich vor
   der oertlichen Sammelstelle an, und beantragen, sich ausliefern zu duerfen,
   nachdem sie gehoert haben, dass mehr als 80 Prozent aller Elefanten sich
   von Microsoft fangen lassen.

APPLE VB's brauchen ebenfalls keine Elefanten zu fangen. sie sammeln nur die 
   Angehoerigen derjenigen ein, die nach der Ankuendigung des letzten Koope-
   rationsvertrages zwischen Apple und Microsoft den Freitod gewaehlt haben.

UNIX VB's brauchen ebenfalls keine Elefanten zu fangen, weil alle Elefanten,
   die nicht bei Apple und Microsoft gelandet sind, einen Anstellungsvertrag 
   als Unix-VB erhalten.

BANKER fangen Elefanten, indem sie sie daraufhinwieisen, dass ihre
   Angehoerigen im Falle einer Flucht selbstverstaendlich die Kosten fuer die
   Kugeln und die Beseitigung des Kadervers zu zahlen haben. Zuzueglich
   eventueller Strafgelder fuer eventuelle Fehlhandlungen von Mitarbeitern
   der Bank die durch fahrlaessiges Fliehen des Elefanten verursacht werden
   und Verzugszinsen ab dem ersten Tag des Anfallens der Kosten.

 Here is a true story someone found regarding exams at Cambridge University.
 It seems that during an examination one day a bright young student
 popped up and asked the proctor to bring him Cakes and Ale.  The following
 dialog ensued:
 
  Proctor: I beg your pardon?
 
  Student: Sir, I request that you bring me Cakes and Ale.
 
  Proctor: Sorry, no.
 
  Student: Sir, I really must insist.  I request and require that you
           bring me Cakes and Ale.
 
 At this point, the student produced a copy of the four hundred year old
 Laws of Cambridge, written in Latin and still nominally in effect, and
 pointed to the section which read (rough translation from the Latin):
 
 "Gentlemen sitting examinations may request and require Cakes and Ale".
 
 Pepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student
 sat there, writing his examination and happily slurping away.
 
 Three weeks later the student was fined five pounds for not wearing a
 sword to the examination.

Beware of mountain roads...

A Software Engineer, a Hardware Engineer and a Departmental Manager
were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were driving down
a steep mountain road when suddenly the brakes on their car failed. The
car careened almost out of control down the road, bouncing off the
crash barriers, until it miraculously ground to a halt scraping along the
mountainside. The car's occupants, shaken but unhurt, now had a
problem: they were stuck halfway down a mountain in a car with no
brakes. What were they to do?

"I know", said the Departmental Manager, "Let's have a meeting, propose
a Vision, formulate a Mission Statement, define some Goals, and by a
process of Continuous Improvement find a solution to the Critical
Problems, and we can be on our way."

"No, no", said the Hardware Engineer, "That will take far too long, and
besides, that method has never worked before. I've got my Swiss Army
knife with me, and in no time at all I can strip down the car's braking
system, isolate the fault, fix it, and we can be on our way."

Well", said the Software Engineer, "Before we do anything, I think we
should push the car back up the road and see if it happens again."

True story:
--------------------------

A guy rings tech support to report that his computer is faulty.
Tech: "What's the problems?"
LUser: "There is smoke coming out of the power supply."
Tech: "You'll need a new power supply."
LUser: "No I don't! I just need to change the startup files."
Tech: "Sir, the power supply is faulty. You'll need to replace it."
LUser: "No way! Someone told me that I just needed to change the startup
and it will fix the problem! All I need is for you to tell me the command."

10 minutes later, the LUser is still adamant that they are right. The Tech
is frustrated and fed up.

Tech: "Sorry, Sir. We don't normally tell our customers this, but there is
an undocumented DOS command that will fix the problem."
LUser: "I knew it!"
Tech: "Just add the line LOAD NOSMOKE.COM at the end of the CONFIG.SYS. Let
me know how it goes."

10 minutes later.

LUser: "It didn't work. The power supply is still smoking."
Tech: "Well, what version of DOS are you using?"
LUser: "MS-DOS 6.22."
Tech: "That's your problem there. That version of DOS didn't come with
NOSMOKE. Contact Microsoft and ask them for a patch that will give you the
file. Let me know how it goes."

1 hour later.

LUser: "I need a new power supply."
Tech: "How did you come to that conclusion?"
LUser: "Well, I rang Microsoft and told him all about what you said, and he
started asking questions about the make of power supply."
Tech: "Then what did he say?"
LUser: "He told me that my power supply isn't compatible with NOSMOKE."

Bill Gates died and, much to everyone's surprise, went to Heaven.  When
he got there, he had to wait in the reception area.

     Heaven's reception area was the size of Massachusetts.  There were
literally millions of people milling about, living in tents with nothing to
do all day.  Food and water were being distributed from the backs of trucks,
while staffers with clipboards slowly worked their way through the crowd.
Booze and drugs were being passed around.  Fights were commonplace.
Sanitation conditions were appalling.  All in all, the scene looked like
Woodstock gone metastatic.

     Bill lived in a tent for three weeks until, finally, one of the
staffers approached him.  The staffer was a young man in his late teens,
face scarred with acne.  He was wearing a blue T-shirt with the words TEAM
PETER emblazoned on it in large yellow lettering.

     "Hello," said the staffer in a bored voice that could have been the
voice of any clerk in any overgrown bureaucracy.  "My name is Gabriel and
I'll be your induction coordinator."  Bill started to ask a question, but
Gabriel interrupted him.  "No, I'm not the Archangel Gabriel.  I'm just a
guy from Philadelphia named Gabriel who died in a car wreck at the age of
17.  Now give me your name, last name first, unless you were Chinese in
which case it's first name first."

     "Gates, Bill."  Gabriel started searching though the sheaf of papers on
his clipboard, looking for Bill's Record of Earthly Works.  "What's going on
here?" asked Bill.  "Why are all these people here?  Where's Saint Peter?
Where are the Pearly Gates?"

     Gabriel ignored the questions until he located Bill's records.  Then
Gabriel looked up in surprise.  "It says here that you were the president of
a large software company.  Is that right?"

     "Yes."

     "Well then, do the math chip-head!  When this Saint Peter business
started, it was an easy gig.  Only a hundred or so people died every day,
and Peter could handle it all by himself, no problem.  But now there are
over five billion people on earth.  Jesus, when God said to 'go forth and
multiply,' he didn't say 'like rabbits!'  With that large a population, ten
thousand people die every hour.  Over a quarter-million people a day.  Do
you think Peter can meet them all personally?"

     "I guess not."

     "You guess right.  So Peter had to franchise the operation.  Now, Peter
is the CEO of Team Peter Enterprises, Inc.  He just sits in the corporate
headquarters and sets policy.  Franchisees like me handle the actual
inductions."  Gabriel looked though his paperwork some more, and then
continued. "Your paperwork seems to be in order.  And with a background like
yours, you'll be getting a plum job assignment."

     "Job assignment?"

     "Of course.  Did you expect to spend the rest of eternity sitting on
your ass and drinking ambrosia?  Heaven is a big operation.  You have to
pull your weight around here!"  Gabriel took out a triplicate form, had Bill
sign at the bottom, and then tore out the middle copy and handed it to Bill.
"Take this down to induction center #23 and meet up with your occupational
orientator.  His name is Abraham."  Bill started to ask a question, but
Gabriel interrupted him. "No, he's not *that* Abraham."

     Bill walked down a muddy trail for ten miles until he came to induction
center #23.  He met with Abraham after a mere six-hour wait.

     "Heaven is centuries behind in building its data processing
infrastructure," explained Abraham.  "As you've seen, we're still doing
everything on paper.  It takes us a week just to process new entries."

     "I had to wait *three* weeks," said Bill.  Abraham stared at Bill
angrily, and Bill realized that he'd made a mistake.  Even in Heaven, it's
best not to contradict a bureaucrat.  "Well," Bill offered, "maybe that
Bosnia thing has you guys backed up."

     Abraham's look of anger faded to mere annoyance.  "Your job will be to
supervise Heaven's new data processing center.  We're building the largest
computing facility in creation.  Half a million computers connected by a
multi-segment fiber optic network, all running into a back-end server
network with a thousand CPUs on a gigabit channel.  Fully fault tolerant.
Fully distributed processing.  The works."

     Bill could barely contain his excitement.  "Wow!  What a great job!
This is really Heaven!"

     "We're just finishing construction, and we'll be starting operations
soon. Would you like to go see the center now?"

     "You bet!"

     Abraham and Bill caught the shuttle bus and went to Heaven's new data
processing center.  It was a truly huge facility, a hundred times bigger
than the Astrodome.  Workmen were crawling all over the place, getting the
miles of fiber optic cables properly installed.  But the center was
dominated by the computers.  Half a million computers, arranged neatly
row-by-row, half a million ....

     .... Ceres ....

     .... all running Oberon software!  Not a PC in sight!  Not a single
byte of Microsoft code!

     The thought of spending the rest of eternity using products that he had
spent his whole life working to destroy was too much for Bill.  "What about
PCs???" he exclaimed.  "What about Windows???  What about Excel???  What
about Word???"

     "You're forgetting something," said Abraham.

     "What's that?" asked Bill plaintively.

     "This is Heaven," explained Abraham.  "We need a computer system that's
heavenly to use.  If you want to build a data processing center based on PCs
running Windows, then ....

     .... GO TO HELL!"

How Mil Specs Live Forever

The US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5
inches. That's an exceedingly odd number.

Why was that gauge used?

Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were
built by English expatriates.

Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines
were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's
the gauge they used.

Why did "they" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways
used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used
that wheel spacing.

Okay! Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to
use any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long distance
roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts.

So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe
were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. The roads have
been used ever since. And the ruts?

The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying
their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since the chariots were
made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel
spacing.

Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United State standard
railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification
(Military Spec) for an Imperial Roman army war chariot.

So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass
came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots
were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two war
horses.

MilSpecs and Bureaucracies live forever.

And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

 Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two
 of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with
 two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. "What do you think
 this is?"
 
 One advisor, an engineer, answered first. "It is a toaster," he said.
 The king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?"
 The engineer replied, "Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write
 a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its
 position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal
 black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a
 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the
 heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected
 from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the
 heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a
 working prototype."
 
 The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the
 danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, "Toasters don't just
 turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What
 you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects
 of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more
 capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also
 cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only
 makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we
 will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years."
 
 "With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to
 the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this
 class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization
 process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins,
 pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon;
 and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached
 eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes."
 
 "The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it
 must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry
 classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved
 without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the
 proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook
 yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the
 kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast
 than to scrambled eggs."
 
 "Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has
 revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast
 food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived
 requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with
 multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold
 while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too."
 
 "We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food
 lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy
 the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When
 the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on
 the screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3'
 appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product
 gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods
 they want to cook."
 
 "Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the
 design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware
 platform for the implementation phase. An Intel Pentium with 40MB of
 memory, a 1.2GB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient. If
 you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports
 multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will
 be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had
 foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a
 four-bit microcontroller!)."
 
 The king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all
 lived happily ever after.

Citation from C. A. R. Hoare, Programming: Sorcery or Science?,
IEEE Software, April 1984.

"Only 30 years ago, our computers' valves and tanks and wires filled
the walls and shelves of a large room, which the programmer would
enter, carrying in his pocket his programming manual-a piece of folded
cardboard known as the FACT CARD. Now the situation is reversed:
the programmer enters a large room whose walls and shelves are
lined with software manuals, but in case he wants to carry out
some urgent calculations, he carries in his pocket-a computer."

Vor einiger Zeit verabredete eine Schweizer Firma ein jaehrliches Wettrudern gegen
eine japanische Firma, das mit dem Achter auf dem Rotsee bei Luzern ausgetragen wurde.
Beide Mannschaften trainierten lange und hart, um ihre hoechsten Leistungsstufen zu
erreichen. Als der grosse Tag kam, waren beide Mannschaften topfit, doch die Japaner
gewannen das Rennen mit einem Vorsprung von einem Kilometer.
Nach dieser Niederlage war das Schweizer Team sehr betroffen und die Moral
war auf dem Tiefpunkt. Das obere Management entschied, dass der Grund fuer diese
vernichtende Niederlage unbedingt herausgefunden werden musste. Ein Projekt-team
wurde eingesetzt, um das Problem zu untersuchen und um geeignete Abhilfemassnahmen
zu empfehlen. Nach langen Untersuchungen fand man heraus, dass bei den Japanern
sieben Leute ruderten und ein Mann steuerte, waehrend im Schweizer Team ein Mann
ruderte und sieben steuerten.
Das obere Management engagierte sofort eine Beraterfirma (Mc Namara), die eine
Studie ueber die Struktur des Schweizer Teams anfertigen sollte. Nach einigen Monaten
und betraechtlichen Kosten kamen die Berater zu dem Schluss, dass zuviele Leute
steuerten und zuwenig ruderten. Um einer weiteren Niederlage gegen die Japaner 
vorzubeugen, wurde die Teamstruktur geaendert. Es gab jetzt vier Steuerleute, zwei
Obersteuerleute, einie Steuerdirektor und einier Ruderer. Ausserdem wurde fuer
den Ruderer ein Leistungsbewertungssystem eingefuehrt, um ihm mehr Ansporn
zu geben. "Wir muessen seinen Aufgabenbereich erweitern und ihm mehr 
Verantwortung geben". Im naechsten Jahr gewannen die Japaner mit einem Vorsprung
von zwei Kilometern!
Das Management entliess den Ruderer wegen schlechter Leistung, verkaufte die
Ruder und stoppte alle Investitionen fuer ein neues Boot. Der Beratungsfirma wurde
ein Lob ausgesprochen und das eingesparte Geld wurde dem oberen Management
ausbezahlt.

Scientists at NASA have developed a gun for the purpose of launching dead
chickens. It is used to shoot a dead chicken at the windshield of an
airline jet, military jet, or the space shuttle, at that vehicle's maximum
traveling velocity. The idea being, that it would simulate the frequent
incidents of collisions with airborne fowl, and therefore determine if the
windshields are strong enough to endure high-speed
bird strikes. British engineers, upon hearing of the gun, were eager to
test the gun out on the windshield of their new high-speed trains.

However, upon the firing of the gun, the engineers watched in shock as the
chicken shattered the windshield, smashed through the control console,
snapped the engineer's backrest in two, and embedded itself into the back
wall of the cabin. Horrified, the engineers sent NASA the results of the
experiment, along with the designs of the windshield, and asked the NASA
scientists for any suggestions.

The NASA scientists sent back a one sentence response:

 Thaw the chicken!!
