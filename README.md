Additions
---------

I've created a directory calls "txt" which contains the plain text
versions of the files in the root directory of the Native Oberon
repository.  They were created using a modified POSIX port of
Miscellaneous.Mod's oberon-7 using the oberon to dos 
translation procedures. Further editing to cleanup extraneous 
byte strings may have introduced errors in the conversion process.
Consider the originals in Oberon format to be authoritive.
